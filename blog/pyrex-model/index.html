<h1>The Pyrex Model</h1>

<pre>
When a company grows not all parts grow at the same speed. 

When a company is small people know each other well. 

People don't like to change much. 

Imagine that people in a company are molecules. And the company made of these people is a glass bowl. 

When you put a glass bowl in the oven it will break. Unless it's pyrex™.

Maybe the company is a tech company. Tech companies need a lot of engineers. 
The company decides that in order to take over the world or put a dent in the universe they need to hire more engineers. 

But to hire fast engineers they need recruiters. And also people in hr to manage these people's happiness and salaries.
Oh.. did you mention salaries? Then maybe we need a finance team etc. 

But these people work on operations. Operations is not so cool. These days tech companies want to be very efficient. Maximize dollars of profit per head. 

So the company decides that it's better to hire more engineers and less HR. 

The pressure to win grows. HR works more hours. Working more hours doesn't solve the problem. HR looks for better tools. 
Hey! We are getting more efficient. This sounds good. 
But it's not enough. The tools are old and silly. 

The heat of the oven is high. But one side of the fish bowl expands more than the other. 
If it's not pyrex™ it will break. 


What is a company that is pyrex™ and what is a company that is not? 

What makes companies less prone to irregular expansion?
