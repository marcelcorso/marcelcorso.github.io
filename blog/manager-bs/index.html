<h1>Manager BS</h1>

<pre>
Being a person is hard. 
A manager is a type of person. 
Being a manager is hard. 

Being a manager is hard because there is no silver bullet. 

Managers they have to deal with people. People problems. People are hard. People problems are hard.  

Managers read a lot of BS on the internet to learn to be a manager. 
Most of the BS doesn't work because it's too broad. 

It's hard to talk about people problems without being too broad. All people are snowflakes. 

What works for a manager in one situation will probably never work again. 

This site has ideas on being a manager, people leader and other BS. 

So what you read in this site is BS. 
ok BS is a too strong word. Let's be SFW: all that is written here is coarse. 

Don't believe in it.
