<h1>Bouncer managers make things go slow</h1>

<pre>
Managers sadly have to make decisions. 

It would be better if every person on the company had all the knowledge in the world to make the best decisions themselves. But because people are limited and cannot learn everything... we are stuck with that. 

But we don't need to settle. People do learn. 
And I'm not going to be the first hippie manager to say that "we should focus on learning bla bla bla". 

But it's easy for managers to accept their position of power and keep making decisions. Or worse: grab more power and make more decisions! 

It's also in the interest of companies sometimes. Companies may think that by adding a bouncer to things they will get 
ownership and accountability right. 
So they say: "we are having too many incidents. Every deploy needs to be approved by the manager!" 

And then the manager, a limited human like every other, has to drop a bunch of other things to review every PR that goes into production. If something goes to production and goes boom then it's the manager's fault. 

Then the manager becomes afraid and takes a long time to review and then.. very little thing goes to production. 



This also happens with product decisions. Sometimes a manager has to decide colors of buttons and stuff like that. There should be other ways. 

I think that making every engineer understand consequences, the product, the market, the design... will make things go faster in the end. But maybe it will take time and maybe some bugs will go into production on the way. Because engineers are not infinite.
