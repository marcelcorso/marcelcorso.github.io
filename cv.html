<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
I'm an all-round developer from Brazil living in Amsterdam. I started learning to code with my father at home when I was very little. 
</p>

<p>
Nowadays I like to code in ruby, python, javascript and go. In the past worked with pascal, c, c++, tcl and java.
</p>

<p>
I'm excited about Go, BIG data and implementing hard algorithms. 
</p>

<p>
I co-founded Shuffler.fm a few years ago. It's all about the open music web. We already did some great things with it, I love it.
